## Hello there üëã

Hi there! I'm Muhammad Afif, a driven and self-taught data engineer with a passion for continually expanding my knowledge. Despite starting my career in mechanical engineering, I was inspired to dive into the exciting world of Big Data and cloud technology, especially during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. I believe that with hard work and dedication, anyone can achieve their goals and pursue their passions. That's why I've dedicated myself to exploring and gaining practical experience with a wide range of tools and technologies in this field.

I'm always eager to learn more and grow as a data engineer. If you're looking for someone who is dedicated, hands-on, and always striving to improve, feel free to connect with me. I'd love to chat about the projects I've worked on and how I can bring my skills and expertise to your organization.
